	<div class="pissarro">
		<p>Camille Pissarro</p>
		<p>(1830-1903)</p>
		<div class="info-pissarro">
			Danish-French Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist painter born on the island of St Thomas.
			He helped establish a collective society of fifteen aspiring artists, becoming the "pivotal"
			figure in holding the group together and encouraging the other members. Paul Cézanne said "he was a father for me. A man to consult and a little like
			the good Lord", and he was also one of Paul Gauguin's masters. Pierre-Auguste Renoir referred
			to his work as "revolutionary", through his artistic portrayals of the "common man", as Pissarro
			insisted on painting individuals in natural settings without "artifice or grandeur".
			Pissarro is the only artist to have shown his work at all eight Paris Impressionist
			exhibitions, from 1874 to 1886. He "acted as a father figure not only to the Impressionists"
			but to all four of the major Post-Impressionists, Georges Seurat, Paul Cézanne, Vincent van
			Gogh, and Paul Gauguin.

	<div class="degas">
	<p>Edgar Degas<p>
	<p>(1834-1917)<p>
		<div class="degas-info">
			<p>A French artist famous for his paintings, sculptures, prints, and
				drawings. He is especially identified with the subject of dance;
				more than half of his works depict dancers. Regarded as one of
				the founders of Impressionism, he rejected the term, preferring to
				be called a realist. He was a superb draftsman, and particularly
				masterly in depicting movement, as can be seen in his rendition of
				dancers, racecourse subjects and female nudes. His portraits are
				notable for their psychological complexity and for their portrayal
				of human isolation. At the beginning of his career, Degas wanted
				to be a history painter, a calling for which he was well prepared
				by his rigorous academic training and close study of classical art.
				In his early thirties, he changed course, and by bringing the
				traditional methods of a history painter to bear on contemporary
				subject matter, he became a classical painter of modern life.</p>

	<div class="sisley">
		<p>Alfred Sisley</p>
		<p>(1839-1899)</p>
		<div class="sisley-info">
			<p>An Impressionist landscape painter who was born and spent most of
				his life in France, but retained British citizenship. He was the
				most consistent of the Impressionists in his dedication to painting
				landscape en plein air (i.e., outdoors). He deviated into figure
				painting only rarely and, unlike Renoir and Pissarro, found that
				Impressionism fulfilled his artistic needs.Among his important
				works are a series of paintings of the River Thames, mostly around
				Hampton Court, executed in 1874, and landscapes depicting places
				in or near Moret-sur-Loing. The notable paintings of the Seine and
				its bridges in the former suburbs of Paris are like many of his
				landscapes, characterized by tranquillity, in pale shades of green,
				pink, purple, dusty blue and cream. Over the years Sisley's power
				of expression and colour intensity increased.</p>

	<div class="cezanne">
		<p>Paul Cézanne</p>
		<p>(1839-1906)</p>

		<div class="cezanne-info">
			<p>A French artist and Post-Impressionist painter whose work laid the
				foundations of the transition from the 19th-century conception of
				artistic endeavor to a new and radically different world of art in
				the 20th century. Cézanne is said to have formed the bridge between
				late 19th-century Impressionism and the early 20th century's new line
				of artistic enquiry, Cubism. Cézanne's often repetitive, exploratory
				brushstrokes are highly characteristic and clearly recognizable. He
				used planes of colour and small brushstrokes that build up to form
				complex fields. The paintings convey Cézanne's intense study of his
				subjects. Both Matisse and Picasso are said to have remarked that
				Cézanne "is the father of us all".</p>

	<div class="monet">
		<p>Claude Monet<p>
			<p>(1840-1926)<p>

				<div class="monet-info">
					<p>A French painter, a founder of French Impressionist painting and
						the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's
						philosophy of expressing one's perceptions before nature,
						especially as applied to plein air landscape painting. The term
						"Impressionism" is derived from the title of his painting Impression,
						soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which was exhibited in 1874 in
						the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon de Paris.[5] Monet's ambition of documenting the French countryside led him to adopt a method of painting the same scene many times in order to capture the changing of light and the passing of the seasons.[6] From 1883, Monet lived in Giverny, where he purchased a house and property and began a vast landscaping project which included lily ponds that would become the subjects of his best-known works. In 1899, he began painting the water lilies,
						first in vertical views with a Japanese bridge as a central feature
						and later in the series of large-scale paintings that was to occupy
						him continuously for the next 20 years of his life.</p>

	<div class="armand">

		<div class="armand-info">
			<p>A French impressionist painter and lithographer. He participated in
				six of the eight Impressionist exhibitions: 1874, 1877, 1880, 1881,
				1882 and 1886. Noted for their intense colours, Guillaumin's paintings are represented in major museums around the world. He is best remembered for his landscapes of Paris, the Creuse département, and the area around Les Adrets-de-l'Estérel near the Mediterranean coast in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region of France. Guillaumin was called the leader of the École de Crozant, a diverse group of painters who came to depict the landscape in the region of the Creuse around the village of Crozant.</p>
