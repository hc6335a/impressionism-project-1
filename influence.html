	<h2>Associates and Inflluenced Artists</h2>

		<p>Among the close associates of the Impressionists
			were several painters who adopted their methods to
			some degree. These include Jean-Louis Forain (who
			participated in Impressionist exhibitions in 1879,
			 1880, 1881 and 1886)[54] and Giuseppe De Nittis, an
			 Italian artist living in Paris who participated
			 in the first Impressionist exhibit at the invitation
			 of Degas, although the other Impressionists disparaged
			 his work.[55] Federico Zandomeneghi was another
			Italian friend of Degas who showed with the
			Impressionists. Eva Gonzalès was a follower of Manet
			who did not exhibit with the group. James Abbott
			McNeill Whistler was an American-born painter who
			played a part in Impressionism although he did not
			join the group and preferred grayed colours. Walter
			Sickert, an English artist, was initially a follower
			of Whistler, and later an important disciple of Degas;
			he did not exhibit with the Impressionists. In 1904
			the artist and writer Wynford Dewhurst wrote the
			first important study of the French painters published
			in English, Impressionist Painting: its genesis and
			development, which did much to popularize
			Impressionism in Great Britain.</p>

			<p>By the early 1880s, Impressionist methods were
				affecting, at least superficially, the art of the
				Salon. Fashionable painters such as Jean Béraud
				and Henri Gervex found critical and financial
				success by brightening their palettes while retaining
				the smooth finish expected of Salon art.[56] Works
				by these artists are sometimes casually referred to
				as Impressionism, despite their remoteness from
				Impressionist practice.</p>

				<p>The influence of the French Impressionists
					lasted long after most of them had died. Artists
					like J.D. Kirszenbaum were borrowing Impressionist
					techniques throughout the twentieth century. </p>

						<h2>Post Impressionism</h2>
					<p>During the 1880s several artists began to develop
						 different precepts for the use of colour, pattern,
						 form, and line, derived from the Impressionist
						 example: Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, Georges
						 Seurat, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. These artists
						 were slightly younger than the Impressionists, and
							their work is known as post-Impressionism. Some of
							the original Impressionist artists also ventured into
							this new territory; Camille Pissarro briefly painted
							 in a pointillist manner, and even Monet abandoned
							 strict plein air painting. Paul Cézanne, who
							 participated in the first and third Impressionist
							 exhibitions, developed a highly individual vision
							 emphasising pictorial structure, and he is more often
							 called a post-Impressionist. Although these cases
							illustrate the difficulty of assigning labels, the
							 work of the original Impressionist painters may,
								by definition, be categorised as Impressionism.<p>
