		<div class="techniques-body-text">

			<div class="techniques-intro">
			<p>French painters who prepared the way for Impressionism
				include the Romantic colourist Eugène Delacroix, the leader
				of the realists Gustave Courbet, and painters of the Barbizon
				school such as Théodore Rousseau. The Impressionists learned
				much from the work of Johan Barthold Jongkind, Jean-Baptiste-Camille
				Corot and Eugène Boudin, who painted from nature in a direct and
				spontaneous style that prefigured Impressionism, and who befriended
				 and advised the younger artists.
				</p>
			</div>


			<div class="list-intro">

				<h2>Identifiable Techniques</h2>
			<p>A number of identifiable techniques and working habits contributed
				to the innovative style of the Impressionists. Although these
				 methods had been used by previous artists—and are often
				 conspicuous in the work of artists such as Frans Hals, Diego
				 Velázquez, Peter Paul Rubens, John Constable, and J. M. W.
				Turner—the Impressionists were the first to use them all
				together, and with such consistency. These techniques include:
			</p>

			<div class="list">
			<ul>
				<li>Short, thick strokes of paint quickly capture the essence of the subject, rather than its details. The paint is often applied impasto.
    		<li>Colours are applied side-by-side with as little mixing as possible, a technique that exploits the principle of simultaneous contrast to make the colour appear more vivid to the viewer.
    		<li>Greys and dark tones are produced by mixing complementary colours. Pure impressionism avoids the use of black paint.
    		<li>Wet paint is placed into wet paint without waiting for successive applications to dry, producing softer edges and intermingling of colour.
    		<li>Impressionist paintings do not exploit the transparency of thin paint films (glazes), which earlier artists manipulated carefully to produce effects. The impressionist painting surface is typically opaque.
    		<li>The paint is applied to a white or light-coloured ground. Previously, painters often used dark grey or strongly coloured grounds.
    		<li>The play of natural light is emphasized. Close attention is paid to the reflection of colours from object to object. Painters often worked in the evening to produce effets de soir—the shadowy effects of evening or twilight.
    		<li>In paintings made en plein air (outdoors), shadows are boldly painted with the blue of the sky as it is reflected onto surfaces, giving a sense of freshness previously not represented in painting. (Blue shadows on snow inspired the technique.)
			</ul>

		<div class="technology">

			<h2>New Technology</h2>

			<p>New technology played a role in the development of the style.
				Impressionists took advantage of the mid-century introduction
				of premixed paints in tin tubes (resembling modern toothpaste
				tubes), which allowed artists to work more spontaneously,
				both outdoors and indoors. Previously, painters made their
				 own paints individually, by grinding and mixing dry pigment
				 powders with linseed oil, which were then stored in animal
				 bladders. <p>
				</p>

				<p>	Many vivid synthetic pigments became commercially available
				to artists for the first time during the 19th century. These
				included cobalt blue, viridian, cadmium yellow, and synthetic
				ultramarine blue, all of which were in use by the 1840s, before
				 Impressionism. The Impressionists' manner of painting made
				 bold use of these pigments, and of even newer colours such as
				 cerulean blue, which became commercially available to artist
				 s in the 1860s. </p>

				<p>The Impressionists' progress toward a brighter style of painting
					was gradual. During the 1860s, Monet and Renoir sometimes painted
					on canvases prepared with the traditional red-brown or grey ground.
					 By the 1870s, Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro usually chose to
					paint on grounds of a lighter grey or beige colour, which functioned
					as a middle tone in the finished painting. By the 1880s, some
					of the Impressionists had come to prefer white or slightly off-white
					grounds, and no longer allowed the ground colour a significant
					role in the finished painting.</p>
				</div>



		<div class="composition">

			<h2>Composition</h2>

			<p>Prior to the Impressionists, other painters, notably such
				17th-century Dutch painters as Jan Steen, had emphasized
				common subjects, but their methods of composition were
				traditional. They arranged their compositions so that the
				main subject commanded the viewer's attention. J. M. W.
				Turner, while an artist of the Romantic era, anticipated
				the style of impressionism with his artwork. The
				Impressionists relaxed the boundary between subject
				and background so that the effect of an Impressionist
				 painting often resembles a snapshot, a part of a larger
				reality captured as if by chance. Photography was
				gaining popularity, and as cameras became more portable
				, photographs became more candid. Photography inspired
				Impressionists to represent momentary action, not only
				in the fleeting lights of a landscape, but in the
				day-to-day lives of people.</p>
			</div>



				<div class="photography">

					<h2>Influence of Photography</h2>

					<p>The development of Impressionism can be considered partly
						as a reaction by artists to the challenge presented by
						photography, which seemed to devalue the artist's skill
						in reproducing reality. Both portrait and landscape
						paintings were deemed somewhat deficient and lacking in
						truth as photography "produced lifelike images much more
						efficiently and reliably".</p>

						<p>In spite of this, photography actually inspired artists
							to pursue other means of creative expression, and rather
							than compete with photography to emulate reality, artists
							 focused "on the one thing they could inevitably do
							 better than the photograph—by further developing into
							 an art form its very subjectivity in the conception
							of the image, the very subjectivity that photography
							eliminated". The Impressionists sought to express
							their perceptions of nature, rather than create exact
							representations. This allowed artists to depict
							subjectively what they saw with their "tacit imperatives
							of taste and conscience". Photography encouraged
							painters to exploit aspects of the painting medium,
							like colour, which photography then lacked: "The
							Impressionists were the first to consciously offer a
							subjective alternative to the photograph".</p>
						</div>

						<div class="japanese-influence">

							<h2>Japanese Influence</h2>

							<p>Another major influence was Japanese ukiyo-e art
								prints (Japonism). The art of these prints contributed
								significantly to the "snapshot" angles and
								unconventional compositions that became characteristic
								 of Impressionism. An example is Monet's Jardin à
								Sainte-Adresse, 1867, with its bold blocks of colour
								and composition on a strong diagonal slant showing
								the influence of Japanese prints<p>
